Alex:
 For loops
 Support more builtins like "range", "len", etc.. 
 Parse module names in function uses, i.e. "np.dot", "parakeet.each"
 Support for trancendentals (log, exp, etc..)
 Support for unary negation
 Closures with nested adverbs don't work right

Eric:
 Logic to detect whether to tile a subtree of code
 Ability to tile only subtrees of a function
 Analysis to determine tile size estimates based on memory accesses
 Proper handling of closure variables
