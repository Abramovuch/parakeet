- Change ast_conversion so it immediately parses functions (instead of bundling up referenced functions as closure variables and parsing them later)
- Parse module names in function uses, i.e. "np.dot", "parakeet.each"
- Support for trancendentals (log, exp, etc..)
- Support for unary negation
- Garbage collection 
- Add support for in-place math operators, i.e. +=, *=, etc... 
- List comprehensions 
- Indexing by boolean masks
- Figure out why parallel launcher segfaults on column sums
- Make a plan for starting parallel jobs from inside compiled code
- Only run tiling on perfectly nested code
- Maybe only use ML tile estimates?
- Vectorization
