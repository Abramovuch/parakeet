Now:
- Indexing by boolean masks

Long term:
- Garbage collection 
- Split up outermost scope into execution plan, 
  i.e. [local_vars1 = run_llvm(fn1, inputs), 
        local_vars2 = parfor(fn2, inputs, local_vars1)
        ...
        return result_vars
       ]
- Factor out LLVM backend into tinyjit
- Add C backend 
- Extend C backend to turn ParFor expressions into CUDA kernels 

On pause:
- Adverb semantics for conv
- Code generation for conv
- Why is the pipeline ordering so fragile? 

Maybe never?
- Factor out shape inference into Shapely
- Adverb-level vectorization 
- starting parallel jobs from inside compiled code

Old:
- Only run tiling on perfectly nested code
