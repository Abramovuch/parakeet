Parakeet: Runtime accelerator for numerical Python

=========

Designed for Python 2.7

Depends on [llvmpy](https://github.com/llvmpy/llvmpy), [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/), and [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/). 

Parakeet isn't ready yet! A lot of syntax is missing from the frontend, 
the parallel launcher has a bad habit of segfaulting and there is no garbage collector. Over the next few months
all these issues (and more) will be resolved and then Parakeet might (maybe) make your numerical code faster. 

...but when it does work, it is a thing of beauty.
